Web Research


	1. 
		A. Tim Berners-Lee founded the W3C in 1994, at the MIT, with support from CERN, ARPA 
	and the European Commission.  The vision was to standardize how the web is built and 
make content available to anyone.

		B. Membership is open to all types of organizations and the cost to join varies country to country and is dependent on what the organization is.

		C. Semantic Web allows a common format for integration of data from a multitude of resourses; instead of concentrating on the interchange of documents.  This will allow doctors or scientists to collaborate work, which 		may help aid research.  In doing a semantic web, data won't be controlled by applications that keep to itself.

	2.
		A. To provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and polices. It is dedicated to ensuring the open development, evolution, and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.
	
		B. The local chapter to me is in Washington DC.  The URL is http://www.isoc-dc.org/ 
and SOC-DC’s mission is to serve the Internet community by promoting the mission and 
values of the Internet Society, by serving as a 			prominent forum in shaping discourse 
about Internet policy issues.

		C. Individual Membership is free. I would recommend that a beginning developer not join, until they fully understand the basics of development; and once they've got an understanding in this then join.  This will allow 			them to gain access to conferences held by the Internet Society and attend educational events. They may also have new ideas to improve on what's already there, and become the voice for what will help sustain a healthy 			Internet.

		B. Iron Chef of Information Security would be and event that I

educate in an entertaining fashion.
