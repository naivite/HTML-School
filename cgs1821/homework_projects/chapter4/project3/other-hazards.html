      <h3>Fire</h3>
      <p>
        Over 1 million household fires, will happen in 2016. Most of these fires could be prevented. Most of these, will be because of cooking accidents, which will will result in injury and death; as well as have costly consequences. It is important that all homes have working fire extinguisher and smoke alarms. Furthermore, it is important to know which fire extinguisher should be purchased, how to is it, and inspect it regularly.  Be sure you have the right fire extinguisher, for the correct task.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Class A: This is suitable for cloth, wood, rubber, paper, various plastics, and regular combustible fires. It is usually filled with 2 1/2 gallons (9.46 litres) of pressurized water.</li>
          <li>Class B: This is suitable for grease, gasoline or oil-based fires is usually filled with a dry chemical. Extinguishers smaller than 6lbs (2.72kg) are not recommended.</li>
          <li>Class C: This is suitable for electrical fires caused by appliances, tools, and other plugged in gear. It can contain either halon or CO2. Halon 1211 and 1301 is very expensive and depletes the ozone layer, but it is being replaced by non-depleting agents such as FM200. Note that halon is now illegal in numerous jurisdictions.</li>
          <li>Class D: This is used for water-reactive metals such as burning magnesium and will be located in factories using such metals. It comes in the form of a powder that must cover the material to extinguish it.</li>
          <li>Class K: This contains a special purpose wet chemical agent for use in kitchen fires and deep fryers to stop fires started by vegetable oils, animal fats, or other fats started in cooking appliances.
          Note that many fire extinguishers will work on a combination of fire classes. You'll need to decide quickly on what type of fire you have and ensure that your fire extinguisher is compatible with the fire you are attempting to extinguish. An all-purpose ABC dry chemical (10lb/4.5kg) extinguisher is a safe bet for most fires, especially when you're not sure of the fire's origins.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        When operating a fire extinguisher, remember the word PASS.  It refers to Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep

      <h3>Carbon Monoxide</h3>
      <p>
        Carbon Monoxide, also known as <abbr title="Carbon Monoxide">CO</abbr>, is called the Invisible Killer, because it is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas.  This gas typically kills individuals who do not have equipment that produces the <abbr title="Carbon Monoxide">CO</abbr>, in properly ventilated space.  There are alarms on the market, that alert you if the <abbr title="Carbon Monoxide">CO</abbr> levels are too high.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things you can do, to protect against Carbon Monoxide Poisoning are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generators should only be used outside of the house, and leave some distance between the house and the generator, so that it doesn't seep inside.</li>
        <li>Do not use camp stove or oven as a heater, indoors</li>
        <li>If you're running your vehicle in the garage, do so with the garage door open.</li>
        <li>Buy a <abbr title="Carbon Monoxide">CO</abbr> detector.</li>
        <li>Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pesticides</h3>
      <p>
        Pesticides come in a few variations, two of which are used for controlling the critters in our gardens and in our houses.  It is important, when using pesiticides, that they are stored out of the reach of children and animals.</p>
      <p>
        The <abbr title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</abbr> claims that the pesticide data show no food safety concerns, but I would still wash my fruits and vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When petsicides are used in the house, for pest control, in the form of a "bug bomb", it is important to read the instructions.  Typically these bombs are designed to create a chemical fog, throughout the room.  It is recommended that you remove all children, pets, toys and uncovered food from treatment areas and to use only one fogger per room.
