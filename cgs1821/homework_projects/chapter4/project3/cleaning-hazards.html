        <p>As consumers, we occasionally review the ingredients in our food, or read the reviews of a product.  We rarely review the chemicals in our oven cleaner, or the safety measure we should take when running a generator.  How many people know how long you should keep Clorox Bleach?  I will discuss common household products that you should never combine.</p>

        <p>
          To put things in perspective, how dangerous these household chemicals can be, during <abbr title="World War I">WWI</abbr> chlorine gas was used as a chemical weapon against the Allied Forces.  It proved to be an effective weapon, since gas masks were inadequate with protection.  In 2015, it was used in Syria, against the civilians.  Chloroform has been used by criminals to knockout their victims and doctors as surgical anesthesia, though it is no longer used in the medical profession.

        <dt>Bleach and Ammonia</dt>
        <dd>These two items are mostly used in everyday household cleaners.  Both can be used to clean toilets, floors, or countertops.  If these two chemicals are combined, they would create hydrazine, hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas, chloramine and chlorine gas.  Inhaling the vapors will attack the mucous membranes and eyes, causing chemical burns.  It could cause respiratory damage and lead to lose of consciousness and could lead to suffocation and death.</dd>
        <dt>Bleach and Vinegar</dt>
        <dd>These two items are also common household cleaners.  Both can be used as disinfectants for cutting boards or countertops.  When combining an acid to bleach, it will create chloramine vapors and chlorine gas.  This too will cause chemical burns, mostly in your eyes and lungs.</dd>
        <dt>Bleach and Rubbing Alcohol</dt>
        <dd>Isopropyl Alcohol is commonly used as a disinfectant and is also used as a solvent.  When combined with bleach, it will create chloroform and hydrochlic acid.  These could damage eyes, lungs, skin, liver, kidneys and your nervous system.  High levels of chloroform exposure may result in death, while lower levels could result in nausea and dizziness.</dd>
