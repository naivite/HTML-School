					My name is Mark Conley, and I am in both the Network Security and Programming Degree track.  My goal with these courses is to get better understanding of the cyber threats that face our daily lives, and how to handle these threats.  Perhaps developing a program that could help protect against these attacks.

					I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS.  I took this class a few summer semesters ago, but had to drop due to family emergency.  Before that	class I did have some experience messing around with HTML in the 90s.  I remember, when I was in high school, learning the basics of how to	use anchors and embedding, to link or embed photos.  In my adolescence I	would spam people's Geocities pages, and in their guestbook, embed images that could not be deleted by the site administrator.  Fun	times! More recently, I've discovered <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and been working on the challenges.  I'm excited to learn more with this class!
