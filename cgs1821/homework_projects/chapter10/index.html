    <p>Whether it is for business trips, family fun, or competition; <abbr title="Captain">Capt</abbr> John Lee has you covered.  Big Time Charters is a locally owned charting service, that offers both offshore and inshore trips.  For a bit of an understanding of the two, <dfn>offshore</dfn> is situated at sea some distance from the shore and <dfn>inshore</dfn> is still at sea, but closer to the shore.</p>
