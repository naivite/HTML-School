      <h4>Inshore</h4>
      <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="placeholder">
      <p>Inshore fishing is any fishing that takes place in water up to thirty meters deep. Equipment used will include light rods and even small nets, which can be utilized to catch the large variety of fish that you can find in shallow waters. The big trophies — blue fin tuna, shark, and the like — will rarely be found in these waters. If it’s big trophies you are hoping for, offshore fishing may be more your speed.</p>

            <h4>Offshore</h4>
      <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="placeholder">
      <p>Offshore fishing is once you hit thirty meters deep. Here, the fish harder to reel in, and the equipment more sturdy. The fishing becomes more athletic and less of a relaxing day out on the boat. It’s safe to say that offshore has more variables, more of the unknown, and a lot more potential physical exertion.</p>
