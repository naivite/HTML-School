          <p>I was first introduced to the sounds of Dropkick Murphys, In late 2001, by a co-worker.  I was stationed in Cheyenne, <abbr title="Wyoming">WY</abbr> at the time, living in a dormatory.  I had  just entered the dormatory, when I heard the sounds of punk music, blaring down the hallway.  As I made my way down the hallway, the sounds had ended and were replaced by the wailing sounds of bagpipes.  These were new sounds to me, as I had never heard them played in the manner I was now hearing them played.  The mixture was melodic and harsh, and I enjoyed it.  I soon began prowling the halls, trying to find which room they had come from, to discover that it was coming from a co-workers room.  The next day at work, I asked him who had been playing, and he invited me over to listen to what he had.  Through them, I had learned of a whole other genre of music, and discovered Flogging Molly, The Pogues, Street Dogs, and The Ducky Boys.  I am no longer in touch with the individual who introduced me to Dropkick Murphys, but I have not forgotten him.</p>
          <p>As of today, <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="http://www.DropkickMurphys.com">Dropkick Murphys</a> have released 9 studio albums, the most recent having been released January 6th, 2017.  Out of their albums, <em>The Gang's All Here</em> is my favorite.  I don't think it is because I love all the songs on it, which I do not, but because of where I was at the time.  I had joined the military, in April of 2001.  Our country was at a relative time of peace.  I arrived to my first duty station, on September 3rd, 2001; and it was the first time I was on my own, in an unfamiliar place.  Then 8 days later, our nation was devastated by the attacks in New York City and Washington <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr>, and as a service member I was now needed to defend our country.  Months after the attacks is when I first heard this album.  It let me forget about the grim feelings I had felt, and let me enjoy myself for the first time since arriving to Wyoming.</p>
