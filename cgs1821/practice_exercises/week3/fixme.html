    The point of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to work with the validator. Trouble shooting errors in code is one of the most valuable skills any programmer can have. It doesn't matter what language, be able to read error codes, research those errors if necessary, and correct them is a huge chunk of the day to day life of a developer. The two most common types of programming errors are:
    </p> <!-- This is a closing paragraph tag, to the first paragraph.-->

    <ol> <!-- This tag starts an ordered list. -->
        <li>Errors causes by Typos</li> <!-- This is a nested list item, within the ordered list. -->
        <li>Logic errors</li> <!-- This is a nested list item, within the ordered list. -->
    </ol> <!-- This tag ends an ordered list. -->

    <p> <!-- This is an opening paragraph tag, to the second paragraph. -->
    In HTML, some of the common errors, made by beginners are:
    </p> <!-- This is a closing paragraph tag, to the second paragraph.-->

    <ol> <!-- This tag starts an ordered list. -->
        <li>Typos in file names and URLs.</li> <!-- This is a nested list item, within the ordered list. -->
        <li>Nesting errors.</li> <!-- This is a nested list item, within the ordered list. -->
        <li>Tags that aren't closed.</li> <!-- This is a nested list item, within the ordered list. -->
    </ol> <!-- This tag ends an ordered list. -->
    
    <p> <!-- This is an opening paragraph tag, to the third paragraph. -->
      <strong><em>Using the Validator is important!</em></strong> <!-- The <strong> tag, boldens the wording and is used for important text
      the <em> tag italicise the wording and is used to make emphasis of the wording. -->

    The more you write code, the more errors you will fix. The more errors you fix the better you will understand that programming language. This includes HTML and CSS
