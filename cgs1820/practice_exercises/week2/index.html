          My name is Mark Conley, and I am a video gamer and paper &amp; pen gamer.  I traditionally
          play RPGs and Sim style games.  My favorite video games would have to be Baldur's Gate,
          Icewind Dale, Dragon Age, Planescape: Torment, and recently SMITE.  With paper &amp; pen
          games, my favorites have been Pathfinder and White Wolf's Changeling.
