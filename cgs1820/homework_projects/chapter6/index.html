            <p>My name is Mark Conley, and I am in both the Network Security and Programming Degree track.  My goal with these courses is to get better understanding of the cyber threats that face our daily lives, and how to handle these threats.  Perhaps developing a program that could help protect against these attacks.</p>
            <p>I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS.  I took this class a few summer semesters ago, but had to drop due to family emergency.  Before that	class I did have some experience messing around with HTML in the 90s.  I remember, when I was in high school, learning the basics of how to	use anchors and embedding, to link or embed photos.  In my adolescence I	would spam people's Geocities pages, and in their guestbook, embed images that could not be deleted by the site administrator.  Fun	times!</p> 
            <p>Some random infomation about myself:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the early days of wifi, I would go war driving, so I could print documents to the victim's shared printers, explaining how to secure their networks.</li>
              <li>I met Dick Van Dyke at The Magic Kingdom, when I was 9.</li>
            </ul>
          </div> <!-- This ends the first column -->
          <div id="column5"><!-- This begins the second column -->
            <p>Last year, I discovered freeCodeCamp, which is an open source community that teaches you web development.  Their goal is to help people learn to code, and in return asking community members to volunteer and create a website for a non-profit organization.  I haven't completed many challenges, but after CGS1820, I will work towards completing them; as well as continuing my education with Santa Fe College.</p>
