	    <p>Today's households contain a wide variety of chemicals that result in hospital visits and sometimes even death.  There are industry regulations that schools and businesses must follow relating to how chemicals are stored and handled.  If a company or school fails to comply, the company or departments are shut down and/or fined.  These may be how flammable liquids are stored, how corrosive materials are handled, or how one protects themselves from chemicals.  Most households do not properly store their flammable liquids or properly protect themselves from toxic fumes or corrosive chemicals.</p>

      <p>People should be aware of what they have in their households and how to properly handle it.  What are the hazards you should look out for, and how do you resolve the dangers?  If you find yourself in an emergency situation, who should be contacted?  What should emergency personnel know?  Fire safety should be practiced at home, but outside of home too.  A lot of forest fires can be contributed to poor judgment.</p>
